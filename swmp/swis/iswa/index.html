They provide emphasis on a movement or expression, and combined with Puncuation Symbols become the equivalent to Exclamation Points. The Tension Symbol, combined with Contact Symbols, provides the feeling of "pressure", and combined with facial expressions can place emphasis or added feeling to an expression. Timing symbols are used to show alternating or simultaneous movement.<h3><a href="cat_4.html">Category 4: Head & Faces</a></h3><p>Starting with the head and then from the top of the face and moving down.<h3><a href="cat_5.html">Category 5: Body</a></h3><p>Torso movement, shoulders, hips, and the limbs are used in Sign Languages as a part of grammar, especially when describing conversations between people, called Role Shifting, or making spatial comparisons between items on the left and items on the right.<br><hr><br><h2>Sequence symbols</h2><p>Only used in the SignSpelling Sequence. Not used for everyday writing.<h3><a href="cat_6.html">Category 6: Detailed Location</a></h3><p>Detailed Location symbols used in the SignSpelling Sequence may be useful for sorting large dictionaries, refining animation, simplifying translation between scripts and notation systems, and for detailed analysis of location sometimes needed in linguistic research.<br><hr><br><h2>Punctuation symbols</h2><p>Always used alone<h3><a href="cat_7.html">Category 7: Punctuation</a></h3><p>Punctuation Symbols are used when writing complete sentences or documents in SignWriting.<br><hr><br><center><table cellpadding="20"><tr><td valign="top" align="middle"><b>ISWA 2010 symbols<br>designed by Valerie Sutton</b><br><a href="http://signwriting.org/lessons/iswa/">Symbol Lessons Online</a><br><a href="http://movementwriting.org/symbolbank/">SymbolBank Archive</a><br></td><td valign="top" align="middle"><b>ISWA 2010 HTML Reference<br>
